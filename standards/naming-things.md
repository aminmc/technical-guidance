## User needs

Users should to be able to infer a basic understanding of what a given
thing does from its name.

## Principles

Names should be self-descriptive â€“ you should be able to infer a basic
understanding of what something does from its name.

Avoid naming things using puns, uncommon acronyms, version numbers, or
with a brand. All of these make it difficult for others to understand
what the thing does. Puns and acronyms (unless they're very widely
understood outside government, like API) probably won't be understood
by anyone coming to your thing later. Version numbers and brand names
(including names of parts of government) are likely to change over time
as the thing adapts to changing user needs and policies.

Ensure you use the same name consistently whenever you're referring to
the same thing. For example, in most cases the name of an application's
GitHub repository should match its hostname. Similarly, the team
responsible for an application should probably be called something
related to the application and its GitHub repositories.

### Examples

These applications are well named as they communicate their purpose
reasonably clearly:

- Help with Fees
- Send Money to a Prisoner
- Claim for Crown Court Defence
- Intranet
- Peoplefinder

The names of these applications are ambiguous and possibly confusing:

- PVB2 (actually the 3rd version of Prison Visits Booking)
- DOMIS (Dummy NOMIS)
- Mojular
- CLA
- Sirius

## Other resources

The service manual has [good guidance for naming
services](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service),
a lot of which will also be relevant when naming applications or
packages.
