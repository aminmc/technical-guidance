## User needs

Users should to be able to infer a basic understanding of what a given
thing does from its name.


## Principles

Names should be self-descriptive â€“ you should be able to infer a basic
understanding of what something does from its name.

Avoid naming things using puns or with a brand, as this will only make
it difficult for others to understand what the thing does.

Ensure you use the same name consistently whenever you're referring to
the same thing. For example, in most cases the name of an application's
GitHub repository should match its hostname.

### Examples

These applications are well named as they communicate their purpose
reasonably clearly:

- Signon (which used to be called signonontron2000)
- Manuals Publisher
- Smart Answers
- Digital Marketplace Admin Frontend
- Notifications PaaS Autoscaler

The names of these applications are ambiguous and possibly confusing:

- Panopticon
- Whitehall
- Rummager
- Maslow
- Magna Charta


## Other resources

The service manual has [good guidance for naming
services](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/naming-your-service),
a lot of which will also be relevant when naming applications or
packages.
