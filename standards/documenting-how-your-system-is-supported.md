# Documenting how your service is supported

All services should have a runbook that describes how they are supported, where they are hosted, and how people outside the team can check their health and report an issue.

Without this, people supporting your service (or just interested in it) may not be able to get in touch with you if there's a problem, and may not be able to understand when to expect support.

## What you should include in your service's runbook

## Where to publish your service's runbook

Your service's runbook doesn't need to be hosted in a central repository, but you should make sure that all your stakeholders and peers are aware of how to find it and link to it from [your infrastructure tags](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/technical-guidance/standards/documenting-infrastructure-owners/#optional) so that people supporting your service's infrastructure can find it if they need to.

You should also make sure that anyone who is likely to need to access your runbook *can* access it. The easiest way to do this is to [publish it openly](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better) on the internet, but your service may have security constraints that mean that isn't possible at the moment.
