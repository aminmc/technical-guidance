# Supporting services out of hours

Many of our services are used outside normal office hours (9am-6pm, Monday-Friday). To make sure people are able to keep using them with confidence, even when problems arise, it's sometimes necessary to have people on call out of hours to help with these problems.

Some services don't need out of hours support. This might be because their users don't rely on it for critical parts of their job, because the users themselves don't need it outside normal office hours, or because the service is robust enough to recover from some problems automatically.

There are also cases where services may need out of hours support, but we're not currently able to provide it without risking the health and well-being of our staff.

## Determining if your service needs support out of hours

Not all services need out of hours support. When considering the need for out of hours support for your service, you need to understand what issues might arise if the service were to go down when no-one is around to fix it, and how likely it is that the service might go down.

The kinds of issues that might suggest out of hours support is necessary include things like:

- Danger to someone's life
- The MOJ's ability to provide critical, time-sensitive justice services
- Impact to staff's and suppliers' ability to do carry out their job safely and to the best of their ability
- Impairing citizens', suppliers', and partners' ability to interact with MOJ services in a way that meets their needs

These and similar issues should be considered alongside your service's robustness.

For example, if your service can recover from most classes of issue itself, and downtime affects only a small group of people whose task is not time-sensitive, out of hours support may not be necessary. If, however, a problem with your service (whether outages, security breaches, or something else) out of hours presents a genuine risk to someone's life, it _may_ be appropriate to provide out of hours support around the clock, depending on the robustness of the system.
